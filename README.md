## Projects:
## Deepfake Images Detection
#### A deep learning-based customized CNN model built to detect deepfakes in an image data set obtained from Kaggle contains 140,000 real and fake images using Python. By comparing the proposed model with 
#### state-of-the-art models, it achieved the highest accuracy of 96%. This demonstrates its potential as a powerful tool for detecting manipulated media content quickly and accurately
## Telco Customer Churn Prediction
#### Developed a predictive model that can identify customers at risk of churning from telecommunications services with 86% accuracy. An oversampling technique has been used to address 
#### the imbalanced issue in the dataset effectively while also investigating the potential attributes that could be responsible for customer churning behavior.
